AS an User
I WANT TO be send a request using verb POST to /quotes endpoint with the body: age, postcode, regNo.
So that i can receive a response with: id, policyNumber, age, postcode, regNo, abiCode, premium.

Notes:
- The vehicle registration number should be checked in a third API to receive a valid ABI Code.
- After receive the hit, the API should look up the base premium to find the rating factors to apply for age, postcode area and ABI code(assume a rating factor of 1 if the value is not in the database)
- The value of premium must be multiplied by each rating factor in turn to obtain a premuim.
- All the quotes details should be saved in the database.
